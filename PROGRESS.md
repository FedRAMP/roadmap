![Roadmap Vibes: a group of folks working on computers while looking out at clouds](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5d9b0eac-6241-4fdb-b2bb-c53af2bb8f26)

## Sprint 11 (2025-10-13 to 2025-10-24)

> The federal government remained shut down during all of Sprint 11; all public-facing activities have been halted, requests for comment remain open, and the phased implementation of 20x is delayed.
>
> Expected timelines for open roadmap items will be adjusted once the shutdown ends.
> 
> For more information see https://fedramp.gov/shutdown

## Sprint 10 (2025-09-29 to 2025-10-10)

> Note: A significant amount of activity has been curtailed by the government shutdown
> effective 2025-10-01; more than half of FedRAMP's federal employees have been
> furloughed and non-essential non-excepted activities are limited.
>
> **This has delayed 20x Phase Two.**

### OPEN Issue [#79: Agency Requirements and Guidance](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/79)

Latest comment (2025-10-09):

This guidance is now delayed indefinitely due the government shutdown. Timeline will be reassessed when the shutdown ends. This activity has been placed into the Hold / Pending status.

### OPEN Issue [#48: Major redesign of marketplace](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/48)

Latest comment (2025-10-09):

All of the federal staff working on this improvement have been furloughed during the current government shutdown; delivery of these improvements will be delayed. 

### CLOSED Issue [#44: Community Outreach - FY25 Q2/Q3 ](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/44)

Latest comment (2025-10-09):

During FY25 Q2/Q3, FedRAMP managed 10+ engagements with the community, with most of these taking place in FY25 Q3. 

### OPEN Issue [#43: Recommended Secure Configuration Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/43)

Latest comment (2025-10-09):

[RFC-0015](https://www.fedramp.gov/rfcs/0015/) is still open; finalization is extremely unlikely to happen as scheduled due to the current government shutdown. The public is advised to submit comment as quickly as possible because after the official closing date this RFC may close at any time unexpectedly.

### OPEN Issue [#31: (2/?) 20x Phase Two](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/31)

Latest comment (2025-10-09):

All previously anticipated Phase Two timelines are likely to shift as a result of the active government shutdown. Please stand by for updates. For more on how this shutdown is affecting FedRAMP, please review https://fedramp.gov/shutdown

### OPEN Issue [#30: Finalize Key Security Indicators (KSIs) for FedRAMP Moderate](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/30)

Latest comment (2025-10-09):

[RFC-0014](https://www.fedramp.gov/rfcs/0014/) is still open; finalization is extremely unlikely to happen as scheduled due to the current government shutdown. The public is advised to submit comment as quickly as possible because after the official closing date this RFC may close at any time unexpectedly.

### OPEN Issue [#3: (1/?) 20x Phase One](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/3)

Latest comment (2025-10-09):

Phase One will be formally closed out when #30 has been finalized. There are still many active Phase One participants whose review may continue during Phase Two. All reviews are temporarily halted due to the ongoing government shutdown: https://fedramp.gov/shutdown



## Sprint 09 (2025-09-15 to 2025-09-26)

### CLOSED Issue [#83: FedRAMP 20x Strategic Vision & Implementation Plan](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/83)

Latest comment (2025-09-28):

This implementation plan was shared widely on 9/24 but still needs to be ported to our web page. We hope to have a youtube link with that presentation soon and will be updating the webpage next month to align with this plan, however you can review the powerpoint with dates and goals below if you missed it.

### CLOSED Issue [#82: [Gov] FedRAMP Day II (Team, Sep 22)](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/82)

Latest comment (2025-09-28):

I wasn't able to attend FedRAMP Day myself but I listened in to the morning session and the feedback overall was positive. Agencies are starting to see the longer term plays and understand the importance of GRC automation tooling, but also seeing the reality that until we have things like the Authorization Data Sharing standard implemented there isn't much to do here.

### CLOSED Issue [#81: 20x Six Month Update & Phase Two and Phase Three Announcement Event (Sep 24, Pete)](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/81)

Latest comment (2025-09-28):

This event was covered by various folks on LinkedIn as well as the traditional media:

- https://meritalk.com/articles/federal-cio-greg-barbaccia-backs-fedramp-20x-shares-ombs-priorities/
- https://www.meritalk.com/articles/gsa-unveils-fedramp-20x-phase-2-pilot-previews-phases-to-come/

-  https://www.executivegov.com/articles/fedramp-20x-phase-2-pilot

We expect a youtube video to be available soon for folks who missed it as well.

### CLOSED Issue [#80: GRC Engineering Podcast (Pete, Sep 16)](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/80)

Latest comment (2025-09-28):

This interview was recorded as planned but appears to be still pending release.

### OPEN Issue [#79: Agency Requirements and Guidance](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/79)

Latest comment (2025-09-28):

Finalization and publication of this guidance has been delayed one sprint as a result of an unexpected event; it should be formalized soon. I've moved the likely end date to October 10 to allow some padding.

### OPEN Issue [#50: External data driven marketplace](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/50)

Latest comment (2025-09-28):

The [Authorization Data Sharing](https://github.com/FedRAMP/docs/blob/main/markdown/FRMR.ADS.authorization-data-sharing.md) standard is optional for Phase One and to date no one has begun to implement it. This standard will be a mandatory requirement for Phase Two and beyond, however, so we're moving the likely delivery dates on this prototype to some point in the future where there should at least be a few cloud service providers making this data available to us in a way that we can prototype properly.

### OPEN Issue [#48: Major redesign of marketplace](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/48)

Latest comment (2025-09-28):

I got to see a really cool working prototype of this last week, but we're still not there yet. Based on the work done to date and current estimates from the team, we might be ready to release this before the end of October but we want to make sure it's ready and clean first.

### OPEN Issue [#43: Recommended Secure Configuration Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/43)

Latest comment (2025-09-28):

[RFC-0015](https://github.com/FedRAMP/community/discussions/84) is still open for two more weeks; this one appears to be relatively straightforward as there is only one public comment at the moment.

### OPEN Issue [#39: Consolidated R5 Continuous Monitoring Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/39)

Latest comment (2025-09-28):

We're shifting this later to ensure we can include the results of [RFC-0016 Collaborative Continuous Monitoring Standard](https://www.fedramp.gov/rfcs/0016/) into any such guide; expect this to be delivered later in the calendar year.

### OPEN Issue [#37: Collaborative Continuous Monitoring Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/37)

Latest comment (2025-09-28):

This was published as [RFC-0016](https://www.fedramp.gov/rfcs/0016/) on September 15! This will be balanced to Rev5 so reviewing and commenting is critical for Rev5-based providers.

### OPEN Issue [#35: FIPS cryptographic module application for commercial services](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/35)

Latest comment (2025-09-28):

I'm moving this forward one sprint because it is one of the lowest priority tasks at the moment; the current [FedRAMP Policy for Cryptographic Module Selection and Use](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Policy_for_Cryptographic_Module_Selection_v1.1.0.pdf) is still applicable.

### OPEN Issue [#34: 20xP2 Moderate Pilot Submission and Review Window](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/34)

Latest comment (2025-09-28):

The [Phase Two](https://fedramp.gov/20x/phase-two) submission window has been publicly announced as likely to occur the week of October 16 to 23. FedRAMP has also clarified that Phase Two will not be open to the public and that cloud service providers must meet specific criteria to participate. This page also has additional information about the expectations for Phase Two, including that it will be much more difficult than Phase One and most providers will need more time and better tools to meet these requirements. We must build 20x together.

### OPEN Issue [#33: Persistent Validation and Assessment Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/33)

Latest comment (2025-09-28):

This was published as [RFC-0017](https://www.fedramp.gov/rfcs/0017/) on September 15! This standard adds significant details to FedRAMP's expectations in Phase Two and beyond; it is a must-review for anyone who is considering FedRAMP 20x at the moment.

### OPEN Issue [#31: (2/?) 20x Phase Two](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/31)

Latest comment (2025-09-28):

The details of Phase Two were publicly announced this week, with additional information to follow over the coming weeks. As always, the source of truth is the web page, this roadmap, and the Community Working Group discussion forums: https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/phase-two

It never fails to amaze me how often people email me asking questions about things that are on our website. 

### OPEN Issue [#30: Finalize Key Security Indicators (KSIs) for FedRAMP Moderate](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/30)

Latest comment (2025-09-28):

Public comment is still open on [RFC-0014](https://www.fedramp.gov/rfcs/0014/) for another two weeks! So far this RFC has not been particularly active but there have been some [really interesting comments overall](https://github.com/FedRAMP/community/discussions/83).

## Sprint 08 (2025-09-01 to 2025-09-12)

### OPEN Issue [#83: FedRAMP 20x Strategic Vision & Implementation Plan](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/83)

Latest comment (2025-09-14):

The strategic vision and implementation plan will be shared publicly on September 24 with the announcement of Phase Two and Phase Three of FedRAMP 20x. For more information and to register for this in-person (and remote) public event replacing the 20x Community Working Group meeting for September, please visit https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/phase-two

### OPEN Issue [#81: 20x Six Month Update & Phase Two and Phase Three Announcement Event (Sep 24, Pete)](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/81)

Latest comment (2025-09-14):

This event will take place on September 24 from 3:30 to 5pm (replacing our scheduled 20x CWG) at ADI's conference space in downtown Washington DC. Formal announcement of this event and registration information will be available soon - keep an eye on https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/phase-two because this event will likely happen before this Roadmap Issue is updated. ;)

### OPEN Issue [#80: GRC Engineering Podcast (Pete, Sep 16)](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/80)

Latest comment (2025-09-14):

This interview is scheduled for September 16 and is expected to be published by the GRC Engineering podcast on September 23.

### OPEN Issue [#79: Agency Requirements and Guidance](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/79)

Latest comment (2025-09-14):

The draft Agency Implementation Guidance (now tentatively renamed Agency Requirements and Guidance but likely to shift again because names are complicated and a lot of people have opinions) will be reviewed and finalized with the FedRAMP Board on September 18 and published shortly afterwards.

This guidance focuses on clarifying existing agency requirements and is not considered new guidance that requires public comment, therefore it will be released much quicker than previously anticipated.

### CLOSED Issue [#75: Billington CyberSecurity Summit (Sep 9, Nicole)](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/75)

Latest comment (2025-09-14):

Nicole totally crushed it on the main stage in a panel that also included FedRAMP Board member Dave McKeown.

### OPEN Issue [#43: Recommended Secure Configuration Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/43)

Latest comment (2025-09-14):

The recommended Secure Configuration Standard was published as RFC-0015 on September 10 and is now open for public comment.

- [RFC-0015 on fedramp.gov](https://www.fedramp.gov/rfcs/0015)
- [RFC-0015 on GitHub](https://github.com/FedRAMP/community/discussions/84)
- [Q&A and casual discussion on RFC-0015](https://github.com/FedRAMP/community/discussions/85)

This activity is expected to be finalized during the third week of October.

### CLOSED Issue [#40: POA&M Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/40)

Latest comment (2025-09-14):

All recommendations about changes to POA&Ms have been directly integrated into the new Vulnerability Detection and Response Standard - for 20x authorizations and for those who adopt the new VDR during the Rev5 closed beta, POA&Ms are no longer relevant.

### CLOSED Issue [#38: Vulnerability Detection and Response Standard (prev Continuous Vulnerability Management Standard)](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/38)

Latest comment (2025-09-14):

This standard has been published as the Vulnerability Detection and Response Standard with many changes - [this thread in the FedRAMP Community](https://github.com/FedRAMP/community/discussions/82#discussioncomment-14355795) summarizes the changes at a high level.

The resulting standard, including the accompanying (and critically important) FedRAMP Definitions, can be reviewed as follows:

- In the [FedRAMP Docs repository on GitHub](https://github.com/FedRAMP/docs) for those who want to see both the latest and how the sausage is made
- On [fedramp.gov](https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/standards) for folks who prefer a direct web source

### OPEN Issue [#37: Collaborative Continuous Monitoring Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/37)

Latest comment (2025-09-14):

The Collaborative Continuous Monitoring Standard is pending final review and publishing for public comment as RFC-0016 by September 16.

### OPEN Issue [#34: 20xP2 Moderate Pilot Submission and Review Window](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/34)

Latest comment (2025-09-14):

In this [Sprint to 20x Phase Two](https://github.com/FedRAMP/community/discussions/82) thread in the FedRAMP Community we have continued to communicate expected changes to previously discussed FedRAMP goals and targets.

Criteria for Phase Two is still in development and finalization but as indicated elsewhere:

[FedRAMP Phase Two will be formally announced on September 24 at 3:30pm.](https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/phase-two)

Participants in Phase Two will be eligible to receive a 12 month FedRAMP 20x Moderate authorization, however, participation will be limited; Phase Two will not be entirely open to the public. We currently anticipate opening up formal 20x Low and Moderate authorizations, reviewed directly by FedRAMP (no agency sponsor required), in February 2026.

### OPEN Issue [#33: Persistent Validation and Assessment Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/33)

Latest comment (2025-09-14):

Now called the Persistent Validation and Assessment Standard, this draft includes requirements and recommendations for both providers and assessors for handling Key Security Indicators. It is planned for release as RFC-0017 as early as September 16.

### OPEN Issue [#30: Finalize Key Security Indicators (KSIs) for FedRAMP Moderate](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/30)

Latest comment (2025-09-14):

Moderate and related Phase Two Key Security Indicators have been published for public comment in RFC-0014:

- [RFC-0014 on fedramp.gov](https://www.fedramp.gov/rfcs/0014)
- [RFC-0014 on GitHub](https://github.com/FedRAMP/community/discussions/83)
- [Casual Q&A and discussion related to RFC-0014 on GitHub](https://github.com/FedRAMP/community/discussions/85)

Completion of this activity is now anticipated to complete by October 14 as we transition into Phase Two.

## Sprint 07 (2025-08-28 to 2025-08-29)

### OPEN Issue [#79: Agency Implementation Guidance](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/79)

Latest comment (2025-09-01):

A fair amount of internal work has been done preparing this to date, but concerted effort to move this forward will begin in September.

### CLOSED Issue [#65: Scope of FedRAMP Guidance / Technical Assistance](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/65)

Latest comment (2025-09-01):

This guidance was approved by OMB and published on August 28! https://www.fedramp.gov/scope

(NOTE: This applies to all FedRAMP authorizations)

### CLOSED Issue [#64: Federal Information Technical Assistance](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/64)

Latest comment (2025-09-01):

The [Authorization Data Sharing standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/docs/blob/main/markdown/FRMR.ADS.authorization-data-sharing.md) includes additional information that was originally included in the draft Federal Information Technical Assistance. This information is not in the full depth of that Technical Assistance but reflects the preferred guidance from OGC at this time. Based on this release, I'm moving this Roadmap item into Delivered.

**Relevant Snippet from Purpose:**

This security and compliance information (including FedRAMP authorization data) is the intellectual property of the cloud service provider and is not federal information in most cases.* The federal government benefits when the same security information is shared among all customers and even the public to ensure maximum transparency and accountability of cloud service providers.

_* Providers with questions about this should consult with a lawyer who specializes in procurement law. Typically a contract with the government granting ownership of information is required to transfer ownership to the government._

### OPEN Issue [#48: Major redesign of marketplace](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/48)

Latest comment (2025-09-01):

Our AppDev team has been performing user research and mapping out necessary improvements to the marketplace - it's really quite exciting and hopefully we will have more to share with explicit goals and possible timelines son!

### OPEN Issue [#43: Recommended Secure Configuration Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/43)

Latest comment (2025-09-01):

A simplified Recommended Secure Configuration Standard should be available as an RFC by September 16.

### OPEN Issue [#42: Agency Reuse Playbook for 20x](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/42)

Latest comment (2025-09-01):

FedRAMP will be focusing primarily on agency AI adoption at the end of this year as outlined in #32 Agency AI Adoption for 20x - part of that project will include creating playbooks for adoption of specific FedRAMP 20x Authorized systems. As part of Phase Three, preparing for wider adoption of all FedRAMP 20x systems, those playbooks and related capabilities will be expanded for general systems and made available to agencies.

### OPEN Issue [#38: Continuous Vulnerability Management Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/38)

Latest comment (2025-09-01):

Public comment on RFC-0012 was extensive; based on considerable feedback, FedRAMP is aggressively working to update this standard prior to release. All activities in progress are subject to change, but current significant changes in progress include:

- Rename to Vulnerability Detection and Response Standard
- Updated potential adverse impact estimation criteria that makes more sense for a third-party commercial service provider
- Separation of numerous best practices into a separate best practice section
- Different timeframe requirements based on the FedRAMP authorization impact level of a cloud service offering
- Increased focus on holistic vulnerability management to clarify that this standard is NOT just about scanning
- Built-in replacement process for POA&Ms

Current target is to release by September 11 for FedRAMP 20x.

### OPEN Issue [#37: Collaborative Continuous Monitoring Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/37)

Latest comment (2025-09-01):

This has been moved to Phase Two to align with work on #33 (Continuous Validation Standard) and #43 (Recommended Secure Configuration Standard). Current target is to publish this standard as an RFC by September 23, though September 16 would be ideal.

### OPEN Issue [#36: Finalize FedRAMP 20x Moderate Authorization Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/36)

Latest comment (2025-09-01):

Finalization of the 20x Moderate authorization standard for wide release has been moved to Phase Three.

### OPEN Issue [#35: FIPS cryptographic module application for commercial services](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/35)

Latest comment (2025-09-01):

Intent for this guidance has been mildly re-scoped to focus on clarification and guidance based on current [FedRAMP Policy for Cryptographic Module Selection and Use](https://www.fedramp.gov/resources/documents/FedRAMP_Policy_for_Cryptographic_Module_Selection_v1.1.0.pdf) that is optimized for FedRAMP 20x. This will allow us to bypass public comment and release this clarified technical assistance as part of 20x Phase Two.

### OPEN Issue [#34: 20xP2 Moderate Pilot Submission and Review Window](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/34)

Latest comment (2025-09-01):

The 20xP2 Moderate submission window is now expected to open in mid-October and close in early December. FedRAMP will be publishing additional information about the expectations for Phase Two soon: https://fedramp.gov/20x/phase-two

### OPEN Issue [#33: Continuous Validation Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/33)

Latest comment (2025-09-01):

Current target is to publish this standard as an RFC by September 23, though September 16 would be ideal. Aligns with #37 Collaborative Continuous Monitoring Standard.

### OPEN Issue [#32: Agency AI Adoption Pilot for 20x](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/32)

Latest comment (2025-09-01):

This roadmap item has been renamed to focus on Agency AI Adoption and will align with the AI Prioritization Process outlined at https://www.fedramp.gov/ai - it has been moved to Phase Two and shifted to match some expected timelines for AI prioritization, but may begin as late as November depending on real world implementations. More information on this shift in priorities will follow over the coming weeks.

### OPEN Issue [#31: (2/?) 20x Phase Two](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/31)

Latest comment (2025-09-01):

Phase Two planning and preparation has begun internally at FedRAMP.

### OPEN Issue [#30: Finalize Key Security Indicators (KSIs) for FedRAMP Moderate](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/30)

Latest comment (2025-09-01):

FedRAMP's KSI team is planning a focused two-day sprint on September 8 and 9 to finalize updates for Moderate KSIs and minor changes to Low KSIs (this will primarily be the addition of a few KSIs as we plan to keep changes to existing KSIs to a minimum).

The goal will be to publish by September 16.

### OPEN Issue [#29: Finalize FedRAMP 20x Low Authorization Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/29)

Latest comment (2025-09-01):

Based on the success of the 20x Phase One (Low) pilot, the FedRAMP team does not have the resources to simultaneously open 20x Low authorizations to the public while running the Phase Two (Moderate) pilot. To optimize for wide release of 20x Low AND Moderate authorizations at the same time, these will both be the focus of 20x Phase Three beginning at the end of Phase Two.

### OPEN Issue [#28: R5.ADS Authorization Data Sharing Standard BIR](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/28)

Latest comment (2025-09-01):

We are planning to launch this balance improvement release for Rev5 at the Sep 3 Community Working Group meeting for Rev5.

### OPEN Issue [#19: R5.MAS Minimum Assessment Standard BIR](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/19)

Latest comment (2025-09-01):

This may be overcome by events in September due to the focus of the FedRAMP Board on AI prioritization. I'm moving this into a Hold / Pending status and deferring until later in the year with a shorter window.

### CLOSED Issue [#15: 20xP1 Low Pilot Submission Window](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/15)

Latest comment (2025-09-01):

The 20x Phase One pilot window was closed for submissions on August 19. **26** submissions passed initial completeness checks.

The FedRAMP team will be reviewing these submissions during September and plans to announce details on next steps later in the month.

### CLOSED Issue [#14: Authorization Data Sharing Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/14)

Latest comment (2025-09-01):

Latest comment (2025-09-01):

Instead of maintaining separate FY25 and FY26 issues as we begin to prepare for FY26, we'll consolidate all ongoing Rev5 activities under this Epic.

This committee meeting was completed as planned - keep an eye out on the [USGSA YouTube channel for the recording](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLvdwyPgXnxxV63RYNfhfIjDLlRLT1nxp_) if you missed it.

### OPEN Issue [#64: Federal Information Technical Assistance](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/64)

Latest comment (2025-08-16):

As of the end of Sprint 6 we are considering moving in a different direction to provide this support. The Authorization Data Sharing Standard incorporates some of the guidance related to federal information that clarifies the intellectual property of cloud service providers is not federal information. We may also update the definition of federal information in FRD-MAS-01 with minor changes to language.

Overall GSA Counsel has concerns about creating separate assistance and information that may be misinterpreted by stakeholders who decide not to consult a lawyer as a result of technical assistance, and advise due to the nature of procurement law we should encourage folks to manage this properly.

I will keep this on the Roadmap moved into Hold / Pending for the moment until we've completed other activities that provide this support.

### CLOSED Issue [#47: Major redesign of fedramp.gov](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/47)

Latest comment (2025-08-16):

The updated site was launched last week! There are a number of gaps, including missing search and some issues with redirects as well as some general opportunities for content improvement but we wanted to get this out so folks could start getting used to it.

This past week we also were able to expand our AppDev team to include a few more folks so we can move towards a more intentional approach from here. The team is getting up to speed and working to establish new norms, but we hope to see continuous progress on the website and movement towards updates to the marketplace soon.

### OPEN Issue [#43: Recommended Secure Configuration Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/43)

Latest comment (2025-08-16):

Work on the RSCS was not advanced during Sprint 6. This is not being moved to Hold / Pending because we still intend to publish this prior to ending the 20xP1 pilot.

### OPEN Issue [#40: POA&M Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/40)

Latest comment (2025-08-16):

The FSCAC meeting on August 14 generated considerable discussion and a significant amount of sound advice and general recommendations. FedRAMP is drafting updates to this policy that heavily factor the FSCAC discussion and conform to the goals outlined in the 20x Announcement _[Aligning FedRAMP POA&Ms with M-24-15: A POA&M for POA&Ms](https://github.com/FedRAMP/community/discussions/70)_.

Intent is to publish these updates as an RFC within the month.

Latest comment (2025-08-16):

The primary progress to set the stage for the Agency Adoption Pilot has been the appointment of new FedRAMP Board members by OMB on August 8. There are additional unannounced priorities that will influence this as well. Stand by for public updates over the coming weeks about this pilot. The start date of August 21 reflects the upcoming Board meeting where this will be discussed and planning will begin, but it may be some time after that before this pilot formally begins.

### OPEN Issue [#31: 20x Phase Two](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/31)

Latest comment (2025-08-16):

Latest comment (2025-08-16):

We're putting activity on Moderate KSIs on hold briefly to focus on completing the Phase One pilot and other unannounced emerging priorities for the team. At this time we still intend to start the Phase Two pilot in October, however similar to Phase One it may start with draft updates to Moderate KSIs in play.

The FFIEC IT Conference brought together over 500 participants from across the financial regulatory and supervisory community from organizations like the Federal Reserve, OCC, FDIC, NCUA, CFPB, and state agencies. Attendees included IT examiners, cybersecurity experts, and risk professionals focused on staying current with federal efforts around cloud oversight and security.

We shared how FedRAMP is evolving into a faster, automation-first framework designed to accelerate secure cloud adoption specifically highlighting the work underway through FedRAMP 20x. The session was well received, with strong engagement and real-time Q&A with FedRAMP. We underscored that FedRAMP’s future is about enabling innovation, not slowing it down, and invited continued collaboration across agencies to help shape and scale the 20x model.

## Sprint 04 (2025-07-07 to 2025-07-18)

Sprint 04 ended with some big wins but also some clear delays as we've started to move and shift expected timelines to account for our reduced front office. On the bright side, Sprint 04 ended with authorization to recruit some internal and contract staff to offset the unexpected attrition.

Latest comment (2025-07-18):

We will continue to add FRMR documents as they are finalized - so far the feedback has been mild but positive, and no one is particularly upset about the simple nature of our new documents not having fancy letterheads/etc. ;) Sufficient work has been done on this roadmap item to move it into standard operational procedure moving forward.

Latest comment (2025-07-18):

The planned Marketplace Data Standard will now be integrated into the Authorization Data Sharing Standard (#13), and initially simplified. As such I'm resetting the timeline for this and closing this issue as delivered (even though the ADS Standard isn't fully delivered, the fact that we've chosen to integrate kinda counts?).

Latest comment (2025-07-18):

This isn't quite ready for release yet but it's getting close! Our part time web devs are doing a great job, and I even jumped in a bit myself this week to help with some server hooks to redirect archived pages. I'm moving the target end date to July 31 and we'll keep plugging away.

### OPEN Issue [#43: Recommended Secure Configuration Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/43)

Latest comment (2025-07-18):

Like many of the other draft standards in progress, this was impacted by unexpected staffing changes and delayed. It is a lower priority than some of the other standards at the moment, so I am moving the likely end date out quite a bit. I don't expect to post the RFC for this prior to August.

### OPEN Issue [#42: Agency Reuse Playbook for 20x](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/42)

### OPEN Issue [#38: Continuous Vulnerability Management Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/38)

Latest comment (2025-07-14):

We have decided to integrate the Continuous Reporting Standard with plans for an updated Continuous Monitoring Performance Standard to create a single Continuous Vulnerability Management Standard.

The draft Continuous Vulnerability Management Standard results from extensive internal discussion, review with stakeholders, and consideration of public comment; it simply makes the most sense to combine both the reporting requirements AND the monitoring requirements in the same standard. As such, this issue has been renamed and prioritized to continue this work, while #13 will be closed as the review of the Continuous Reporting Standard has been completed.

### OPEN Issue [#37: Collaborative Continuous Monitoring Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/37)

### OPEN Issue [#30: Finalize Key Security Indicators (KSIs) for FedRAMP Moderate](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/30)

Latest comment (2025-07-18):

I'm now expecting to publish the Moderate KSIs as an RFC in early/mide August, which pushes the end date out a bit.

### OPEN Issue [#28: R5.ADS Authorization Data Sharing Standard BIR](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/28)

Latest comment (2025-07-18):

If we're able to finalize the Authorization Data Sharing Standard next sprint, I expect to immediately move to a beta test on this standard for Rev5. As soon as the ADS is posted we will include information for interested participants to sign up for the closed beta.

### OPEN Issue [#23: R5.CRS Continuous Vulnerability Management Standard BIR](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/23)

Latest comment (2025-07-12):

The Continuous Reporting Standard is now being folded into a new Continuous Vulnerability Management Standard that will require a new RFC and further adjustments. As such, this Rev5 BIR has been shifted forward to track the projected completion of the new Continuous Vulnerability Management Standard.

### OPEN Issue [#19: R5.MAS Minimum Assessment Standard BIR](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/19)

Latest comment (2025-07-18):

I'm moving consideration of the Minimum Assessment Standard BIR to September based on a continued lack of interest. We'll work with the FedRAMP Board in August or September to determine if we want to just move this into wide release as an optional approach for Rev5 Agency Authorizations and let CSPs just identify whether they are using the MAS or the legacy boundary concept.

We now have approximately ~8 candidates who have accepted invitations to the closed beta, though we are waiting for additional information for some of those candidates and a few others. The plan currently is to begin working with closed beta participants next week to discuss the approach and their upcoming changes in more detail, then to host group discussions and align folks on best practices and lessons learned as we deliver. Stay tuned for updates in an upcoming Rev5 working group session that will hopefully include discussion with participants!

As of the end of Sprint 04, here's where we stand with the FedRAMP 20x Pilot:

- 11 total 20x pilot submissions
- 4 have been moved to In Process

We'll keep moving these forward! It is likely we will close the pilot to submissions on August 15 as planned, then spend some time focusing on formalizing requirements for open submissions.

### OPEN Issue [#14: Authorization Data Sharing Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/14)

Latest comment (2025-07-18):

We're about 2/3 of the way through a rewrite of this standard - it is taking longer than expected but barring the unexpected we should be able to close this up for initial pilot and beta testing at the end of next sprint.

This standard is now internally designated as the Authorization Data Sharing Standard (Designator: ADS).

### CLOSED Issue [#13: Continuous Reporting Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/13)

Latest comment (2025-07-12):

We have decided to integrate the Continuous Reporting Standard with plans for an updated Continuous Monitoring Performance Standard to create a single Continuous Vulnerability Management Standard.

### CLOSED Issue [#68: [Gov Only] Interagency FedRAMP Day (Team, June 24)](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/68)

Latest comment (2025-06-25):

OMB hosted nearly a hundred agency liaisons for the entire day in the first of
what may become quarterly events. The message from OMB and GSA executive
leadership was strong and consistent support of FedRAMP and modernizing agency
processes to improve the government wide approach to assessment and
authorization of cloud services.

### OPEN Issue [#65: Scope of FedRAMP Guidance / Technical Assistance](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/65)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

Finalization of this guidance has been delayed due to unexpected staffing
changes. We're now anticipating updates through early July with approval from
OMB sometime that month.

### OPEN Issue [#64: Federal Information Technical Assistance](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/64)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

Finalization of the RFC justification and approval by OGC has been delayed due
to unexpected staffing changes. Updated goal is to release this for public
comment during the second week of July, which extends predicted finalization to
the third or fourth week of August.

### CLOSED Issue [#62: FSCAC - Administrative Work (June 27)](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/62)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

This was strictly an administrative meeting where we met some of the new members
of the Federal Secure Cloud Advisory Committee (FSCAC) and discussed changes to
the committee's priorities under the new administration.

The FAS Commissioner, TTS Director, and FedRAMP Director have been delegated
authority for the Administrator's functions in 44 USC § 3616 and directed to
ensure the committee provides measurable value on specific topics where the
members of the committee are best positioned to represent stakeholders. This is
in-line with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 44 USC § 3616, and the FSCAC
charter.

**For an upcoming meeting in August (still to be scheduled), the FSCAC has been
charged as follows:**

The next public meeting will focus on advice and recommendations for reducing
the burden and cost of managing Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms) for
cloud services and agencies. FedRAMP requires cloud service providers to
maintain POA&Ms
[in a very specific way](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/CSP_POAM_Template_Completion_Guide.pdf)
to assist agencies in identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and monitoring the
progress of corrective efforts for security weaknesses but this approach has not
been revisited in depth for over twenty years.

FedRAMP intends to prepare an updated draft POA&M standard that FedRAMP
authorized cloud service providers would follow to effectively demonstrate their
ongoing plans to remediate weaknesses while giving agency customers the
information they need to make continuous authorization decisions and assess
their overall posture. FedRAMP is asking the FSCAC to propose key elements of
this standard by addressing at least the following questions:

1. What are the major pain points with the current POA&M implementation for CSPs
   and agencies?
2. What are the security gaps and increased risks (including missed
   opportunities) that result from the current model?
3. What are the benefits of the current model?
4. What would a new set of POA&M requirements for FedRAMP that addresses the
   major pain points, and gaps while maintaining or increasing the benefits of
   such a process for all parties look like?

This panel was a huge success with broadly positive feedback. It showed the
value in investing more time and effort into building intentional community
working group meetings and extending them to an hour. Moving forward we'll be
shifting to a monthly cadence for our two working groups so we can plan more
quality content like this.

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

I recorded this discussion in official capacity earlier today! It was an
interesting discussion about 20x, how it has landed amongst the community, what
folks learned so far, and how this is leading us towards creating a new
ecosystem of tooling to support real security across the entire government. I
hope folks find it interesting when it's released.

### CLOSED Issue [#59: ADI Progress Report / Q&A (Pete, June 25)](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/59)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

In general, FedRAMP tries to accept all reasonable meeting invites for industry
trade associations and similar opportunities to have frank conversations with a
number of stakeholders at the same time. The Alliance for Digital Innovation
(https://alliance4digitalinnovation.org/) invited me to speak with their members
at a recent quarterly meeting and we spent this time discussing the changes to
FedRAMP and reviewing our public content.

This was the first time maybe ever that I spoke with a group of cloud service
providers without them constantly beating up on FedRAMP or asking FedRAMP to do
more stuff. It was mostly informational and focused on how our improvements
would be rolled out and how adoption would work. I think this is an excellent
sign that FedRAMP is on the right track, confirmed by similar discussions with a
different group the next day.

In general, FedRAMP tries to accept all reasonable meeting invites for industry
trade associations and similar opportunities to have frank conversations with a
number of stakeholders at the same time. The Cloud Service Providers - Advisory
Board (https://www.csp-ab.com/) invited me to speak with their members at a
recent quarterly meeting and we spent this time discussing the changes to
FedRAMP and reviewing our public content.

This meeting focused primarily on questions about timelines and impacts to
currently authorized providers. It was appreciated that FedRAMP had recently
released this Roadmap giving insight into our realistic working targets and I
hope the members and other folks in the community will continue to refer to
these materials for the latest plans.

Pushing out target release to July 22 due to unexpected staffing changes but the
team has been making great progress in spite of this. We're looking at options
internally to boost momentum on these improvements overall. This is primarily a
look and feel update designed to make it easier to make further improvements
later, so we're excited to be getting closer to release.

### OPEN Issue [#43: Recommended Secure Configuration Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/43)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

An initial internal draft policy for the RSCS has been started. This needs
additional work before sharing with the TAG and CISA; current plans are to ship
to key stakeholders by the end of next week (July 11).

### OPEN Issue [#40: POA&M Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/40)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

We've decided to do something different with the updated POA&M standard; instead
of the FedRAMP team directly developing this standard, the Federal Security
Cloud Advisory Committee (FSCAC) has been formally charged with providing advice
and recommendations on how the POA&M process should be shifted for cloud service
providers and agencies specific to FedRAMP requirements. That meeting will take
place in early August.

As such, we have moved this to 20x Phase Two with a start date of shortly before
the to-be-scheduled FSCAC meeting with a plan to draft and publish an updated
standard for public comment within two weeks of that meeting.

### OPEN Issue [#38: Continuous Monitoring Performance Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/38)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

Due to unexpected changes in staffing, work on the CMPS update was not started
in Sprint 02 as planned. It will shift to Sprint 04, with a goal of beginning
work July 7 and public release by July 22. This will shift the planned end date
to approximately September 12.

### OPEN Issue [#30: Finalize Key Security Indicators (KSIs) for FedRAMP Moderate](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/30)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

A significant amount of internal work has already been done to draft moderate
KSIs but further effort on finalizing and publishing these KSIs will be delayed
to allow staff to focus on reviewing 20xP1 submissions due to the success of the
20xP1 pilot.

### OPEN Issue [#28: R5.SSAD Storing and Sharing Authorization Data BIR](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/28)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

Planning for this balance improvement test has been delayed due to delays on #14
(Storing and Sharing Authorization Data Standard). All timelines are shifting at
least two weeks later.

### OPEN Issue [#23: R5.CRS Continuous Reporting Standard BIR](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/23)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

(Continuous Reporting Standard). All timelines are shifting at least two weeks
later.

### OPEN Issue [#19: R5.MAS Minimum Assessment Standard BIR](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/19)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

Due to a general lack of interest in participation and to ensure the team can
focus on the Rev5 SCN closed beta, I'm re-prioritizing this and pushing it to
later in July. We'll revisit at the end of next month to see if moving
immediately towards an open beta might make more sense.

In the interim, if you or anyone you know is interested in shifting their Rev5
approach to be based around the Minimum Assessment Standard, please drop us a
note at rev5@fedramp.gov so we can track your interest. Thanks!

### OPEN Issue [#16: R5.SCN Significant Change Notification BIR](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/16)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

We now have approximately ~8 candidates who have accepted invitations to the
closed beta, though we are waiting for additional information for some of those
candidates and a few others. The plan currently is to begin working with closed
beta participants next week to discuss the approach and their upcoming changes
in more detail, then to host group discussions and align folks on best practices
and lessons learned as we deliver. Stay tuned for updates in an upcoming Rev5
working group session that will hopefully include discussion with participants!

### OPEN Issue [#14: Storing and Sharing Authorization Data Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/14)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

Initial review of public comment has been completed and a fair bit of change is
necessary to prepare this for testing and evaluation. Due to unexpected staffing
changes, estimated completion of this task has been delayed. It is now targeted
for the end of Sprint 04 on July 18.

### CLOSED Issue [#12: Significant Change Notification Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/12)

Latest comment (2025-06-17):

The Significant Change Notification Requirements, including technical
assistance, have been published as Release 25.06A on fedramp.gov and in the
FedRAMP Machine-Readable Docs repository:
https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/standards/scn/

These requirements will be continuously tested and evaluated during the 20x
Phase One Pilot and Rev5 Balance Improvement Test and improved prior to wide
release.
