## Recovery Sprint (2025-06-30 to 2025-07-04)

The week of July 4 was a recovery sprint for the FedRAMP team, focusing on team
tasks such as:

- Realigning teams based on staffing changes
- Building out some processes for tasks that were onerous in the previous month
  of delivery sprints

### CLOSED Issue [#60: Paramify Podcast 20x Roundtable (Pete, June 30)](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/60)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

I recorded this discussion in official capacity earlier today! It was an
interesting discussion about 20x, how it has landed amongst the community, what
folks learned so far, and how this is leading us towards creating a new
ecosystem of tooling to support real security across the entire government. I
hope folks find it interesting when it's released.

## Delivery Sprint 2 (2025-06-16 to 2025-06-27)

### CLOSED Issue [#68: [Gov Only] Interagency FedRAMP Day (Team, June 24)](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/68)

Latest comment (2025-06-25):

OMB hosted nearly a hundred agency liaisons for the entire day in the first of
what may become quarterly events. The message from OMB and GSA executive
leadership was strong and consistent support of FedRAMP and modernizing agency
processes to improve the government wide approach to assessment and
authorization of cloud services.

### OPEN Issue [#66: FRMR - Machine-Readable Requirements & Information](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/66)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

Ongoing improvements to FRMR continue - last week, control mappings for Key
Security Indicators were added and the template process updated to create human
readable versions both with and without control mappings.

### OPEN Issue [#65: Scope of FedRAMP Guidance / Technical Assistance](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/65)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

Finalization of this guidance has been delayed due to unexpected staffing
changes. We're now anticipating updates through early July with approval from
OMB sometime that month.

### OPEN Issue [#64: Federal Information Technical Assistance](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/64)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

Finalization of the RFC justification and approval by OGC has been delayed due
to unexpected staffing changes. Updated goal is to release this for public
comment during the second week of July, which extends predicted finalization to
the third or fourth week of August.

### CLOSED Issue [#62: FSCAC - Administrative Work (June 27)](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/62)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

This was strictly an administrative meeting where we met some of the new members
of the Federal Secure Cloud Advisory Committee (FSCAC) and discussed changes to
the committee's priorities under the new administration.

The FAS Commissioner, TTS Director, and FedRAMP Director have been delegated
authority for the Administrator's functions in 44 USC § 3616 and directed to
ensure the committee provides measurable value on specific topics where the
members of the committee are best positioned to represent stakeholders. This is
in-line with the Federal Advisory Committee Act, 44 USC § 3616, and the FSCAC
charter.

**For an upcoming meeting in August (still to be scheduled), the FSCAC has been
charged as follows:**

The next public meeting will focus on advice and recommendations for reducing
the burden and cost of managing Plans of Action and Milestones (POA&Ms) for
cloud services and agencies. FedRAMP requires cloud service providers to
maintain POA&Ms
[in a very specific way](https://www.fedramp.gov/assets/resources/documents/CSP_POAM_Template_Completion_Guide.pdf)
to assist agencies in identifying, assessing, prioritizing, and monitoring the
progress of corrective efforts for security weaknesses but this approach has not
been revisited in depth for over twenty years.

FedRAMP intends to prepare an updated draft POA&M standard that FedRAMP
authorized cloud service providers would follow to effectively demonstrate their
ongoing plans to remediate weaknesses while giving agency customers the
information they need to make continuous authorization decisions and assess
their overall posture. FedRAMP is asking the FSCAC to propose key elements of
this standard by addressing at least the following questions:

1. What are the major pain points with the current POA&M implementation for CSPs
   and agencies?
2. What are the security gaps and increased risks (including missed
   opportunities) that result from the current model?
3. What are the benefits of the current model?
4. What would a new set of POA&M requirements for FedRAMP that addresses the
   major pain points, and gaps while maintaining or increasing the benefits of
   such a process for all parties look like?

### CLOSED Issue [#61: 20x CWG Pilot Panel Discussion (Team, June 25)](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/61)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

This panel was a huge success with broadly positive feedback. It showed the
value in investing more time and effort into building intentional community
working group meetings and extending them to an hour. Moving forward we'll be
shifting to a monthly cadence for our two working groups so we can plan more
quality content like this.

More background on the panel is available here:
https://github.com/FedRAMP/community/discussions/47

### CLOSED Issue [#59: ADI Progress Report / Q&A (Pete, June 25)](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/59)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

In general, FedRAMP tries to accept all reasonable meeting invites for industry
trade associations and similar opportunities to have frank conversations with a
number of stakeholders at the same time. The Alliance for Digital Innovation
(https://alliance4digitalinnovation.org/) invited me to speak with their members
at a recent quarterly meeting and we spent this time discussing the changes to
FedRAMP and reviewing our public content.

This was the first time maybe ever that I spoke with a group of cloud service
providers without them constantly beating up on FedRAMP or asking FedRAMP to do
more stuff. It was mostly informational and focused on how our improvements
would be rolled out and how adoption would work. I think this is an excellent
sign that FedRAMP is on the right track, confirmed by similar discussions with a
different group the next day.

### CLOSED Issue [#58: CSP-AB Progress Report / Q&A (Pete, June 26)](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/58)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

In general, FedRAMP tries to accept all reasonable meeting invites for industry
trade associations and similar opportunities to have frank conversations with a
number of stakeholders at the same time. The Cloud Service Providers - Advisory
Board (https://www.csp-ab.com/) invited me to speak with their members at a
recent quarterly meeting and we spent this time discussing the changes to
FedRAMP and reviewing our public content.

This meeting focused primarily on questions about timelines and impacts to
currently authorized providers. It was appreciated that FedRAMP had recently
released this Roadmap giving insight into our realistic working targets and I
hope the members and other folks in the community will continue to refer to
these materials for the latest plans.

### OPEN Issue [#47: Major redesign of fedramp.gov](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/47)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

<img width="1198" alt="Image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/04e51599-ff60-4b64-b38e-a0c4a3ef3b16" />

Pushing out target release to July 22 due to unexpected staffing changes but the
team has been making great progress in spite of this. We're looking at options
internally to boost momentum on these improvements overall. This is primarily a
look and feel update designed to make it easier to make further improvements
later, so we're excited to be getting closer to release.

### OPEN Issue [#43: Recommended Secure Configuration Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/43)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

An initial internal draft policy for the RSCS has been started. This needs
additional work before sharing with the TAG and CISA; current plans are to ship
to key stakeholders by the end of next week (July 11).

### OPEN Issue [#40: POA&M Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/40)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

We've decided to do something different with the updated POA&M standard; instead
of the FedRAMP team directly developing this standard, the Federal Security
Cloud Advisory Committee (FSCAC) has been formally charged with providing advice
and recommendations on how the POA&M process should be shifted for cloud service
providers and agencies specific to FedRAMP requirements. That meeting will take
place in early August.

As such, we have moved this to 20x Phase Two with a start date of shortly before
the to-be-scheduled FSCAC meeting with a plan to draft and publish an updated
standard for public comment within two weeks of that meeting.

### OPEN Issue [#38: Continuous Monitoring Performance Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/38)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

Due to unexpected changes in staffing, work on the CMPS update was not started
in Sprint 02 as planned. It will shift to Sprint 04, with a goal of beginning
work July 7 and public release by July 22. This will shift the planned end date
to approximately September 12.

### OPEN Issue [#30: Finalize Key Security Indicators (KSIs) for FedRAMP Moderate](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/30)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

A significant amount of internal work has already been done to draft moderate
KSIs but further effort on finalizing and publishing these KSIs will be delayed
to allow staff to focus on reviewing 20xP1 submissions due to the success of the
20xP1 pilot.

### OPEN Issue [#28: R5.SSAD Storing and Sharing Authorization Data BIR](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/28)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

Planning for this balance improvement test has been delayed due to delays on #14
(Storing and Sharing Authorization Data Standard). All timelines are shifting at
least two weeks later.

### OPEN Issue [#23: R5.CRS Continuous Reporting Standard BIR](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/23)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

Planning for this balance improvement test has been delayed due to delays on #13
(Continuous Reporting Standard). All timelines are shifting at least two weeks
later.

### OPEN Issue [#19: R5.MAS Minimum Assessment Standard BIR](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/19)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

Due to a general lack of interest in participation and to ensure the team can
focus on the Rev5 SCN closed beta, I'm re-prioritizing this and pushing it to
later in July. We'll revisit at the end of next month to see if moving
immediately towards an open beta might make more sense.

In the interim, if you or anyone you know is interested in shifting their Rev5
approach to be based around the Minimum Assessment Standard, please drop us a
note at rev5@fedramp.gov so we can track your interest. Thanks!

### OPEN Issue [#16: R5.SCN Significant Change Notification BIR](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/16)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

We now have approximately ~8 candidates who have accepted invitations to the
closed beta, though we are waiting for additional information for some of those
candidates and a few others. The plan currently is to begin working with closed
beta participants next week to discuss the approach and their upcoming changes
in more detail, then to host group discussions and align folks on best practices
and lessons learned as we deliver. Stay tuned for updates in an upcoming Rev5
working group session that will hopefully include discussion with participants!

### OPEN Issue [#14: Storing and Sharing Authorization Data Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/14)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

Initial review of public comment has been completed and a fair bit of change is
necessary to prepare this for testing and evaluation. Due to unexpected staffing
changes, estimated completion of this task has been delayed. It is now targeted
for the end of Sprint 04 on July 18.

### CLOSED Issue [#12: Significant Change Notification Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/12)

Latest comment (2025-06-17):

The Significant Change Notification Requirements, including technical
assistance, have been published as Release 25.06A on fedramp.gov and in the
FedRAMP Machine-Readable Docs repository:
https://www.fedramp.gov/20x/standards/scn/

These requirements will be continuously tested and evaluated during the 20x
Phase One Pilot and Rev5 Balance Improvement Test and improved prior to wide
release.

Latest comment (2025-06-11):

Event was completed as planned June 10. Unsure if a recording will be available
at a future date.

Generally this discussion did not cover any new ground, but summed up the last
few months of work, the direction, and other information shared in community
working groups.

### Issue [#61: 20x CWG Pilot Panel Discussion (Team, June 25)](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/61)

Latest comment (2025-06-12):

During Sprint 01, the team identified four cloud service providers and two
independent assessors that were active participants in the 20x pilot to invite
to a panel discussion on June 25. The team began planning for the event,
including agendas, pre-work, questions, etc. Additional information about the
event will be shipped to the community next week!

### Issue [#47: Major redesign of fedramp.gov](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/47)

Latest comment (2025-06-12):

Team continues to move forward on new look and feel but is no longer on track
for mid-June due to our senior engineer needing to take extended leave. Shifting
the nominal end date / release to Sprint 3/4 and will reassess prioritized
changes.

### Issue [#41: Establish DISA ILx One Way Reciprocity](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/41)

Latest comment (2025-06-12):

During Sprint 01, the team continued to discuss reciprocity with DISA and will
continue discussions next sprint. There is no detailed information about this to
make public at this time beyond the intent to establish this reciprocity. 🤞

### Issue [#19: R5.MAS Minimum Assessment Scope BIR](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/19)

Latest comment (2025-06-12):

During Sprint 01:

- Identified potential candidates for R5.MAS.B1
- Drafted Beta Test requirements and guidelines for participation
- Completed initial outreach to some potential candidates

Initial outreach identified less appetite from likely candidates. Team will
reassess priority and approach to R5.MAS.B1 and may consider an open application
process instead. During the next sprint, team will focus on refining the
requirements and making a decision on how to start the next phase.
