### Issue [#65: Scope of FedRAMP Guidance / Technical Assistance](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/65)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

Finalization of this guidance has been delayed due to unexpected staffing changes. We're now anticipating updates through early July with approval from OMB sometime that month.

### Issue [#64: Federal Information Technical Assistance](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/64)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

Finalization of the RFC justification and approval by OGC has been delayed due to unexpected staffing changes. Updated goal is to release this for public comment during the second week of July, which extends predicted finalization to the third or fourth week of August.

### Issue [#47: Major redesign of fedramp.gov](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/47)

Pushing out target release to July 22 due to unexpected staffing changes but the team has been making great progress in spite of this. We're looking at options internally to boost momentum on these improvements overall. This is primarily a look and feel update designed to make it easier to make further improvements later, so we're excited to be getting closer to release. 

### Issue [#43: Recommended Secure Configuration Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/43)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

An initial internal draft policy for the RSCS has been started. This needs additional work before sharing with the TAG and CISA; current plans are to ship to key stakeholders by the end of next week (July 11). 

### Issue [#40: POA&M Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/40)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

We've decided to do something different with the updated POA&M standard; instead of the FedRAMP team directly developing this standard, the Federal Security Cloud Advisory Committee (FSCAC) has been formally charged with providing advice and recommendations on how the POA&M process should be shifted for cloud service providers and agencies specific to FedRAMP requirements. That meeting will take place in early August.

As such, we have moved this to 20x Phase Two with a start date of shortly before the to-be-scheduled FSCAC meeting with a plan to draft and publish an updated standard for public comment within two weeks of that meeting.

### Issue [#38: Continuous Monitoring Performance Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/38)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

Due to unexpected changes in staffing, work on the CMPS update was not started in Sprint 02 as planned. It will shift to Sprint 04, with a goal of beginning work July 7 and public release by July 22. This will shift the planned end date to approximately September 12.

### Issue [#30: Finalize Key Security Indicators (KSIs) for FedRAMP Moderate](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/30)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

A significant amount of internal work has already been done to draft moderate KSIs but further effort on finalizing and publishing these KSIs will be delayed to allow staff to focus on reviewing 20xP1 submissions due to the success of the 20xP1 pilot.

### Issue [#28: R5.SSAD Storing and Sharing Authorization Data BIR](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/28)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

Planning for this balance improvement test has been delayed due to delays on #14  (Storing and Sharing Authorization Data Standard). All timelines are shifting at least two weeks later.

### Issue [#23: R5.CRS Continuous Reporting Standard BIR](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/23)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

Planning for this balance improvement test has been delayed due to delays on #13 (Continuous Reporting Standard). All timelines are shifting at least two weeks later.

### Issue [#19: R5.MAS Minimum Assessment Standard BIR](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/19)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

Due to a general lack of interest in participation and to ensure the team can focus on the Rev5 SCN closed beta, I'm re-prioritizing this and pushing it to later in July. We'll revisit at the end of next month to see if moving immediately towards an open beta might make more sense.

In the interim, if you or anyone you know is interested in shifting their Rev5 approach to be based around the Minimum Assessment Standard, please drop us a note at rev5@fedramp.gov so we can track your interest. Thanks!

### Issue [#16: R5.SCN Significant Change Notification BIR](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/16)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

We now have approximately ~8 candidates who have accepted invitations to the closed beta, though we are waiting for additional information for some of those candidates and a few others. The plan currently is to begin working with closed beta participants next week to discuss the approach and their upcoming changes in more detail, then to host group discussions and align folks on best practices and lessons learned as we deliver. Stay tuned for updates in an upcoming Rev5 working group session that will hopefully include discussion with participants!

### Issue [#14: Storing and Sharing Authorization Data Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/14)

Latest comment (2025-06-30):

Initial review of public comment has been completed and a fair bit of change is necessary to prepare this for testing and evaluation. Due to unexpected staffing changes, estimated completion of this task has been delayed. It is now targeted for the end of Sprint 04 on July 18.

### Issue [#13: Continuous Reporting Standard](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues/13)
