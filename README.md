# FedRAMP Public Roadmap

This repository tracks Issues for majority delivery activity* for FedRAMP's
high level public roadmap. 

The associated Public Roadmap project board provides
different views for understanding priorities and activity:

- [The Roadmap View](https://github.com/orgs/FedRAMP/projects/25/views/1) is a
  traditional project view grouped by major workstreams, shown over time.

- [The Table View](https://github.com/orgs/FedRAMP/projects/25/views/4) shows
  additional information in a more information-dense spreadsheet-style view.

- [The By Date View](https://github.com/orgs/FedRAMP/projects/25/views/8) shows
  everything by start and end date without grouping by major workstream,
  showcasing the sheer quantity of continuously ongoing delivery activity
  managed by the team.

To see how things progress and change over time without a complicated view,
you can instead just [catch up on our Progress Updates from each 
sprint](PROGRESS.md).

_* Items that appear on our public roadmap are one-time activities that 
require a minimum of many days of work for multiple staff members. This 
roadmap does NOT include most internal government activities even though
a significant amount of FedRAMP's work involves such activities._

## How FedRAMP Delivers

We have three cross-functional teams with different focus areas for both
operational and delivery activities. Large scale delivery tasks often flow 
between teams and coordination across all teams is critical for success. We
are currently organizing work around sprints mapped to goals and 
deliverables on our working roadmap.

![FedRAMP's three teams: Protocol, Bastion, and Vanguard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b98850a-00ae-47de-b7df-9ec5b06509cd)

- **Protocol** is responsible for oversight of the entire team's work, setting
  strategy, building 20x, coordinating with stakeholders, and delivering
  updated FedRAMP requirements. This team has **8** individuals, including the
  Director and Security Director.

- **Bastion** focuses on Rev5, including legacy agency authorizations,
  balancing Rev5 against 20x, handling most incoming info@ requests and
  package requests, and managing the Rev5 Community Working Group. They
  also support on 20x package reviews and improvements. This team has **9**
  individuals.

- **Vanguard** focuses on 20x, reviewing packages, building out
  improvements based on real-world evaluation and testing, and managing the
  20x Community Working Group. They also support on Rev5 package reviews
  and improvements as needed. This team has **7** individuals.
