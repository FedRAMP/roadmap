## How FedRAMP Delivers

We have three cross-functional teams with different focus areas for both
operational and delivery activities. Large scale delivery tasks often flow
between teams and coordination across all teams is critical for success. We are
currently organizing work around sprints mapped to goals and deliverables on our
working roadmap.

![FedRAMP's three teams: Protocol, Bastion, and Vanguard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b98850a-00ae-47de-b7df-9ec5b06509cd)

- **Protocol** is responsible for oversight of the entire team's work, setting
  strategy, building 20x, external communications, coordinating with
  stakeholders, and delivering updated FedRAMP requirements. Protocol also
  includes the AppDev team responsible for improving the website and
  marketplace. This team has **8** individuals, including the Director and
  Security Director.

- **Bastion** focuses on Rev5, including legacy agency authorizations, balancing
  Rev5 against 20x, handling most incoming info@ requests and package requests,
  and managing the Rev5 Community Working Group. They also support on 20x
  package reviews and improvements. This team has **11** individuals.

- **Vanguard** focuses on 20x, reviewing packages, building out improvements
  based on real-world evaluation and testing, and managing the 20x Community
  Working Group. They also support on Rev5 package reviews and improvements as
  needed. This team has **14** individuals.

## Budget, Resources, and Planning

FedRAMP is one of many programs operating within the Technology Transformation
Services in the General Services Administration that receives funding from the
Federal Citizen Services Fund (FCSF).

In FY24, approximately $6mil from the American Rescue Plan (ARP) and $18mil from
the FCSF were allocated to FedRAMP (for a total allocation of ~$24mil).

In FY25, approximately ~$22mil from the FCSF was initially allocated to FedRAMP
until the target was adjusted to ~$11mil in FY25 Q2. In that time period FedRAMP
canceled nearly all spending that was not allocated directly for staff (both
federal employees and contractors).

FedRAMP peaked at 80 total staff in January, fell to a low of 20 in July, and
will end FY25 with 28 total staff.

### Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) begins October 1, 2025

For FY26, approximately ~$10mil has been allocated from the FCSF to FedRAMP, to
be spent almost entirely on staff. 

FedRAMP will operate in FY26 with an absolute minimum of support staff as it did
during the last half of FY25. We will be entirely focused on aggressively
implementing the strategic vision for FedRAMP outlined in M-24-15, delivering
authorizations (both Rev5 and 20x) at a record pace, providing limited customer
service, and slowly improving the FedRAMP Marketplace.

As always, we anticipate these plans may be overcome by events. A federal hiring
freeze and changes to the federal hiring process means there is a significant
gap between having budget to hire and being able to hire. The FY26 budget
process for the government is unlikely to go smoothly, with the FCSF having
already been in a continuing resolution for all of FY25 and budgets coming out
of congressional committees cutting it significantly. And FedRAMP's primary
technical support contract will need to be recompeted at the end of FY26, a
process which does not ensure continuity of contractor staff.

Thank you for your patience and understanding as we continually adjust our plans
and strategies in response to the changing realities of our operating
environment. We remain committed to transparency and will continue to use this
working Roadmap to demonstrate how these changes will be reflected in our work.
