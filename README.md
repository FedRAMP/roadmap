# FedRAMP Public Roadmap

This repository tracks **significant
[one-time activities](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20sort%3Aupdated-desc)**
for FedRAMP that are planned, in progress, or recently completed.

- The
  [Public Roadmap project board](https://github.com/orgs/FedRAMP/projects/25/views/1)
  shows a traditional roadmap view of these activities grouped by major
  initiative over time.

- Updates after each sprint are also available in [PROGRESS.md](PROGRESS.md).

This is a **working repository** - FedRAMP actively uses this to plan and track
our work at a high level. Each sprint is planned using this board and it is
updated to reflect changes and progress.

> Planned activities on this roadmap, including specific goals and dates, are
> subject to change based on many factors. All completion dates are aspirational
> targets for awareness only and are likely to shift based on the changing
> environment.

## How FedRAMP Delivers

We have three cross-functional teams with different focus areas for both
operational and delivery activities. Large scale delivery tasks often flow
between teams and coordination across all teams is critical for success. We are
currently organizing work around sprints mapped to goals and deliverables on our
working roadmap.

![FedRAMP's three teams: Protocol, Bastion, and Vanguard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b98850a-00ae-47de-b7df-9ec5b06509cd)

- **Protocol** is responsible for oversight of the entire team's work, setting
  strategy, building 20x, coordinating with stakeholders, and delivering updated
  FedRAMP requirements. This team has **8** individuals, including the Director
  and Security Director.

- **Bastion** focuses on Rev5, including legacy agency authorizations, balancing
  Rev5 against 20x, handling most incoming info@ requests and package requests,
  and managing the Rev5 Community Working Group. They also support on 20x
  package reviews and improvements. This team has **9** individuals.

- **Vanguard** focuses on 20x, reviewing packages, building out improvements
  based on real-world evaluation and testing, and managing the 20x Community
  Working Group. They also support on Rev5 package reviews and improvements as
