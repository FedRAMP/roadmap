![FedRAMP Public Roadmap](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d70192d-1db3-4fd2-9a18-f369a697aa26)

### This repository tracks **significant [one-time activities](https://github.com/FedRAMP/roadmap/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aopen%20sort%3Aupdated-desc)** for FedRAMP that are planned, in progress, or recently completed.

- The
  [**Public Roadmap project board**](https://github.com/orgs/FedRAMP/projects/25/views/1)
  shows a traditional roadmap view of these activities grouped by major
  initiative over time.

- Updates after each sprint are also available in
  [**PROGRESS.md**](PROGRESS.md).

- _**Last Update: 2025-10-14 at the end of Sprint 10.**_

This is a **working repository** - FedRAMP actively uses this to plan and track
our work at a high level. Each sprint is planned using this board and it is
updated to reflect changes and progress.

> Planned activities on this roadmap, including specific goals and dates, are
> subject to change based on many factors. All completion dates are aspirational
> targets for awareness only and are likely to shift based on the changing
> environment.

## How FedRAMP Delivers

We have three cross-functional teams with different focus areas for both
operational and delivery activities. Large scale delivery tasks often flow
between teams and coordination across all teams is critical for success. We are
currently organizing work around sprints mapped to goals and deliverables on our
working roadmap.

![FedRAMP's three teams: Protocol, Bastion, and Vanguard](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b98850a-00ae-47de-b7df-9ec5b06509cd)

- **Protocol** is responsible for oversight of the entire team's work, setting
  strategy, building 20x, external communications, coordinating with
  stakeholders, and delivering updated FedRAMP requirements. Protocol also
  includes the AppDev team responsible for improving the website and
  marketplace. This team has **8** individuals, including the Director and
  Security Director.

- **Bastion** focuses on Rev5, including legacy agency authorizations, balancing
  Rev5 against 20x, handling most incoming info@ requests and package requests,
  and managing the Rev5 Community Working Group. They also support on 20x
  package reviews and improvements. This team has **9** individuals.

- **Vanguard** focuses on 20x, reviewing packages, building out improvements
  based on real-world evaluation and testing, and managing the 20x Community
  Working Group. They also support on Rev5 package reviews and improvements as
  needed. This team has **11** individuals.

## Budget, Resources, and Planning

FedRAMP is one of many programs operating within the Technology Transformation Services in the General Services Administration that receives funding from the Federal Citizen Services Fund (FCSF).

In FY24, approximately $6mil from the American Rescue Plan (ARP) and $18mil from the FCSF were allocated to FedRAMP (for a total allocation of ~$24mil). 

In FY25, approximately ~$22mil from the FCSF was initially allocated to FedRAMP until the target was adjusted to ~$11mil in FY25 Q2. In that time period FedRAMP canceled nearly all spending that was not allocated directly for staff (both federal employees and contractors).

FedRAMP peaked at 80 total staff in January, fell to a low of 20 in July, and will end FY25 with 28 total staff.

### Fiscal Year 2026 (FY26) begins October 1, 2025

For FY26, approximately ~$10mil has been allocated from the FCSF to FedRAMP, to be spent almost entirely on staff. This budget targets growth from **16** to **24** (+8) federal employees and from **12** to **19** (+7) contractors for a total staff of **43** (+15). 

FedRAMP will operate in FY26 with an absolute minimum of support staff as it did during the last half of FY25. We will be entirely focused on aggressively implementing the strategic vision for FedRAMP outlined in M-24-15, delivering authorizations (both Rev5 and 20x) at a record pace, providing limited customer service, and slowly improving the FedRAMP Marketplace. 

As always, we anticipate these plans may be overcome by events. A federal hiring freeze and changes to the federal hiring process means there is a significant gap between having budget to hire and being able to hire. The FY26 budget process for the government is unlikely to go smoothly, with the FCSF having already been in a continuing resolution for all of FY25 and budgets coming out of congressional committees cutting it significantly. And FedRAMP's primary technical support contract will need to be recompeted at the end of FY26, a process which does not ensure continuity of contractor staff.

Thank you for your patience and understanding as we continually adjust our plans and strategies in response to the changing realities of our operating environment. We remain committed to transparency and will continue to use this working Roadmap to demonstrate how these changes will be reflected in our work.
